                Hey! I'm Justin and I enjoy creating and exploring new things.
                I'm currently attending the University of Michigan as a junior studying computer science + statistics.
                I'm looking to find a career in full stack development and/or machine learning,
                but also interested in learning mobile dev & other fields on the side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of classes, I'm always trying to engage myself with new knowledge and tackle challenging
                projects. I'm involved in statistics and analytics through my student-led
                <a href="https://www.wolverinesportsanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sports
                    analytics club</a> on campus.
                Recently I've done my first in-person
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justin-yang-2021_had-so-much-fun-at-mhacks-last-weekend-activity-7134331304363388929-b8uY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hackathon</a>
                and plan to hunt for more to attend! Furthermore, I'm diving deeper into
                machine learning through research on conformal prediction with
                <a href="https://yashpatel5400.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yash Patel</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I can be found on the tennis courts, in the gym, or hanging out with friends.
                Since college, I've picked up interests such as snowboaring and playing the guitar.
                I love board games, especially Settlers of Catan (sheep superiority!) and when I'm winding down for the
                day
                I enjoy reading self-improvement books like Atomic Habits.
