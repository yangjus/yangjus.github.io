        <p>
            Hey! I'm Justin and I enjoy creating and exploring new things.
            I currently reside in Ann Arbor where I attend the University of Michigan as an undergraduate junior.
            I plan to graduate in Fall 2024, with a major in computer science + a minor in statistics, and look to find
            a career in full stack development and/or machine learning.
            I'm also interested in learning mobile dev and trying new fields on the side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of classes, I'm always trying to engage myself with new knowledge and tackle challenging projects.
            Besides the personal software projects I set myself to (such as this website!), I'm also engaged in
            statistics and analytics through my student-led 
            <a href="https://www.wolverinesportsanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sports analytics club</a> on campus.
            Recently I've done my first in-person 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justin-yang-2021_had-so-much-fun-at-mhacks-last-weekend-activity-7134331304363388929-b8uY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hackathon</a> 
            and plan to hunt for more to attend! Furthermore, I'm diving deeper into
            machine learning through research on conformal prediction with 
            <a href="https://yashpatel5400.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yash Patel</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I can be found on the tennis courts, in the gym, or hanging out with friends.
            Since college, I've picked up a lot of interests, such as snowboaring and playing the guitar.
            I love board games, especially Settlers of Catan (sheep superiority!) and when I'm alone
            I enjoy reading self-improvement books like Atomic Habits.
